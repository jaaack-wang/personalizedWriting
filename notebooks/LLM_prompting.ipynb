Because they are off-balance sheet and interest gets capitalized, we think it makes sense to take a quarterly reserve approximating the actual interest charges.  In the event a turbine is \"flipped\", East, West and South share in the total gain.  We could establish upfront a transfer price, say cost + $3MM, for transfers into a project.  With everyone sharing in the pain and the gain, we should be able to make the optimal decision for EA.  \n",

However, it is probably in Enron's interest to have people looking for alternative uses while Brett is trying to firm up his deal.  In 3-4 months we should have a defintive plan for these machines-if we wait 2-3 months for Brett to continue, we may not have a definitive plan for 5-7 months.\n",

Some of munis (Roseville, Palo Alto) are trying to combine the long term purchase with a muni bond issue in order to prepay for the power.  The basic structure is that they borrow money from the tax-exempt market (6%), give the proceeds to the power supplier (who values the money at 7%++) and they effectively get cheaper power.   \n",

Generally, we have paid over our cost of funds for this cash because it does not show up as debt.   In my discussions with Joe, he thinks our $ bid should be based on alternative markets for off-balance sheet cash, which might mean LIBOR plus 50-150 bp.   This sounds reasonable until I think of the fact that I am being charged 15% for balance sheet funds.  The bid/offer for balance sheet cash should not be 7%X15%.   \n",

None of those were acceptable to DWR.  The option will therefore expire at 5:00 PPT today.  Vikram Budraja, Advisor to Gov Davis, suggested that we are not dealing in good faith and suggested that he will speak with Ken Lay (we have heard this several dozen times).

Chip is going to push them a little more and if necessary get Hancock to call Ben Glisan to assure us that they are in (Hancock wants a lot of future business from Enron).  In the meantime, we are innovatively stalling GE by requiring some consent language up front so we get another day from them.  I think we will get both sides of this trade done.\n",

      "Several projects and deals are progressing as planned: Allegheny, Black Hills, and Northland Power are reviewing documents for a purchase and sale agreement targeting a June 30 signing and August 31 funding. Roseville exercised a $6 million ERC option from Georgia Pacific and is working on development and CEC applications. AMPS received complete emissions data and is negotiating deals to install or lease two units, with Oregon Steel leading discussions. Blue Dog’s $3.5 million turbine sale income recognition shifted from Q3 to Q2. Reliant has not accepted a 100MW Mid-C offer due to VAR constraints, but other generators like Duke and Constellation show interest in synthetic tolls. DWR’s bid remains valid but has decreased by $2-$3/MWh due to falling western prices. No significant changes in margin or hotlist summary were noted.\n",
